                    We get it though. When youâ€™re in the early stages of your
                    career, building alone is frustrating and defeating, and it
                    can be challenging to come up with project ideas on your
                    own.

                <p>
                    Our program helps you escape Tutorial Hell by giving you
                    practical, hands-on programming experience while having the
                    support of amazing mentors by your side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We remove the stress of coming up with project ideas by
                    giving you meaningful projects specifically tailored to your
                    skillset. Our projects have specific guidelines and learning
                    objectives, so you can focus solely on building and learning
